	<b><i>Abstract:</i></b><br />
	Chloride peroxidase (CPO; <a href="query?cmd=Search&q=1.11.1.10">EC 1.11.1.10</a>)
	catalyses the halogenation of a number of aliphatic substrates in the reaction:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
	RH + X<sup>&ndash;</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = RX + <b>2</b> H<sub>2</sub>O
</p>
<p>
	(where RH = substrate, X = Cl, Br, I, but not F). CPO demonstrates remarkable
	diversity with respect to the reactions which it catalyses. A number of
	structurally different enzymes have been characterised: CPO from the marine
	fungus <i>Caldariomyces fumago</i> (<i>Cf</i>CPO), which is a heme-thiolate
	protein; bacterial CPOs without any metal prosthetic group or metal ion (CPO-L);
	vanadate-containing CPOs; and CPO from the marine worm <i>Notomastus lobatus</i>
	which represents a flavoprotein:hemoprotein complex.
	<br/>
	Although the primary biological function of CPO seems to be chlorination,
	<i>Cf</i>CPO also exhibits peroxidase, dehydrogenase, catalase and monooxygenase
	activities. The capability of CPO to perform these diverse reactions makes it
	one of the most versatile of all known heme proteins.
	<br/>
	The structures of <i>Cf</i>CPO bound with small diatomic or triatomic ligands
	such as CO, NO, CN<sup>&ndash;</sup> and NCS<sup>&ndash;</sup> have been
	determined, but so far the co-crystallisation of this enzyme with organic
	substrates has been unsuccessful. Recently, K&uuml;hnel and co-athors have
	solved the structure of <i>Cf</i>CPO complexed with its natural substrate

	(PDB:<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/msdlite/atlas/ligands/2cix.html"
	target="_blank">2CIX</a>).
	The authors also report structures of <i>Cf</i>CPO co-crystallised with either
	bromide or iodide, and could identify several binding sites, which suggest a
	pathway for halide access to the heme.
