	<b><i>Abstract:</i></b><br/>
	GAPDH is an NAD<small><sup>+</sup></small>-dependent glycolytic enzyme
	that catalyses the formation of <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:16001">
	1,3-bisphosphoglycerate</a> from <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:29052">
	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</a> and <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:18367">phosphate
	</a>. Once thought to solely play a role in
	glycolysis, mammalian GAPDH has been implicated in many other cellular
	activities, including apoptosis, nuclear RNA transport, DNA replication,
	DNA repair, RNase activity, microtubule bundling and membrane fusion.
	Accordingly, GAPDH is thought to play roles in many diseases, including
	Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease,
	dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy and prostate cancer.
	Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of human GAPDH at high
	resolution would facilitate the development of specific inhibitors of
	GAPDHs from parasites as well as new anti-apoptosis drugs for the
	treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The recently reported
	high-resolution (1.75 &Aring;) crystal structure of <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/msdlite/atlas/summary/1u8f.html">human
	GAPDH</a> provides an updated view of the <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:15846">NAD<small>
	<sup>+</sup></small></a>-binding site,
	which is the target of inhibitors designed to combat parasitic diseases.
	The structure also provides a foundation for investigating the
	interactions between an anti-apoptosis compound <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:35364">CGP-3466
	</a> and human GAPDH.
