	<b><i>Abstract:</i></b><br />
		Ultraviolet sunlight damages genomic DNA by forming lesions, the major
		chemical form of which is a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formed by
		the cycloaddition of two adjacent pyrimidine rings.
		Deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase (EC 4.1.99.3) repairs the CPD of DNA
		and has been found in various organisms. The enzyme utilizes visible
		light as an energy source to cleave the cyclobutane linkage. Photolyases
		are known to have two chromophores with independent roles to harvest the
		light energy and to catalyse the reaction. <a target="_blank"

		is found in all known photolyases as a catalytic cofactor and transfers
		an electron to CPD. Two prosthetic groups are well known as
		light-harvesting cofactors. One is
		<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:15638"
		target="_blank">5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate</a>, which is found in the
		<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/msdlite/atlas/ligands/1dnp.html"
		target="_blank">photolyase from <i>Escherichia coli</i></a> and the other is
		<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/chempdb/cgi-bin/cgi.pl?FUNCTION=getByCode&CODE=HDF"
		target="_blank">8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin</a>,
		which is found in the
		<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/msdlite/atlas/ligands/1qnf.html"
		target="_blank">photolyase from <i>Anacystis nidulans</i></a>. Recently,
		<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:17621"
		target="_blank">FMN</a>
		was found as a light-harvesting cofactor in photolyase from <i>Thermus
		thermophilus</i> [1]. The first crystal structure of an archaeal
		photolyase from an acidothermophilic archaeon, <i>Sulfolobus
		tokodaii</i> (St-photolyase), has been reported at 2.8 &Aring;
		resolution [PDB:<a href="http://oca.ebi.ac.uk/oca-bin/ocaids?id=2e0i"
		target="_blank">2E0I</a>].
		Unexpectedly, an FAD molecule was identified at the position of the
		light-harvesting cofactor of St-photolyase [2]. This cofactor appears to
		be incorporated during the expression of the recombinant St-photolyase
		in <i>E. coli</i>. This second FAD molecule is well accommodated within
		the crystal structure, suggesting that FAD works as a novel
		light-harvesting cofactor of photolyase.</p>
