    <b><i>Abstract:</i></b><br/>
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:16199"
target="_blank">Urea</a>
is highly stable in aqueous solutions ranging in pH from 2 to 12, with a half-life of 3.6 years
at 38 &deg;C [1]. The non-enzymatic degradation of urea in aqueous solution proceeds via elimination,
yielding <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:16134"
target="_blank">ammonia</a>
and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:29202"
target="_blank">isocyanic acid</a>
as sole products:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">urea &rarr; HNCO + NH<sub>3</sub></p>

<p>
In contrast, urease carries out a true hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonia and
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:28616"
target="_blank">carbamic acid</a>, which is
further decomposed into ammonia and CO<sub>2</sub> [2]:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
urea + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; carbamic acid + NH<sub>3</sub>
<br>
carbamic acid &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>
</p>

<p>The <em>k</em><sub>cat</sub>/<em>K</em><sub>M</sub> of urease is 10<sup>14</sup>-fold higher
than the rate of the uncatalysed elimination reaction, implying the "proficiency" of urease
is &gt;10<sup>14</sup>, because the uncatalysed hydrolysis reaction must be even slower
(in fact it was never observed) [1].
<br>
The crystallisation of jack bean urease by James Sumner in 1926 provided firm proof of the
protein nature of enzymes and brought him
<a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/"
target="_blank">the Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>
20 years later "for his discovery that enzymes can be crystallized". However, it was not
until 1975 that it was revealed that the active site of this enzyme contains two nickel atoms [2].
One unusual feature is that the metal atoms are bridged by an
<em>N</em><sup>6</sup>-carboxy-<small>L</small>-lysine residue.
Several isoforms of urease such as canatoxin display insecticidal effects that are
independent of ureolytic activity and require proteolytic processing of the protein by insect enzymes.
It was hypothesised that the plant ureases are protoxins, and can be considered to be the plant arsenal
of defenses against insects [3].
