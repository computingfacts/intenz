	<b><i>Abstract:</i></b><br />
	Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is one of Nature's
	most remarkable proteins. It is the only known protein capable of adding atmospheric
	<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:16526"
	target="_blank">carbon dioxide</a>
	(CO<sub>2</sub>) directly to a sugar chain and is responsible for the
	CO<sub>2</sub> fixation of plants. The enzyme can also act with
	<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:15379"
	target="_blank">dioxygen</a>
	(O<sub>2</sub>) in a competing reaction. The enzyme from plants and algae
	exists as a complex consisting of eight large and eight small subunits,
	where each dimer binds a
	<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:18420"
	target="_blank">Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion</a>
	crucial for the catalytic activity [1]. Interestingly, a CO<sub>2</sub>
	molecule other than the substrate is required to complete the assembly of
	the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding site in RuBisCO. This CO<sub>2</sub> molecule
	adds to the uncharged &#949;-amino group of Lys-201 to form a carbamate.
	This negatively charged adduct then binds the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. The
	enzyme complex has a very low turnover, less than 3 per second, and so to
	compensate for this it is present in very large amounts, making it the
	most abundant protein on Earth.<br/>
	Recently, Tcherkez <i>et al.</i> [2] have analysed kinetic and isotope-fractionation
	data obtained from the literature for RuBisCOs from a wide diversity of
	organisms and observed clear correlations between the CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>
	specificity. They argue that, within the "architectural" constraints
	imposed by the physical and chemical properties of CO<sub>2</sub>, the
	catalytic properties of RuBisCO enzymes from various organisms have evolved
	to match their differing gaseous environments nearly perfectly.
