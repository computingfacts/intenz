            The IntEnz flat file writer module dumps enzyme data in SIB's
            <code>enzyme.dat</code> format.
            <br/>
            The dump is done every night. The resulting file is downloaded by SIB,
            and at some point they release a new version of the flat file in both
            SIB's and EBI's ftp servers.

		<subsection name="DE line modifications">
			EC numbers which have been transferred to more than one target EC number
			or whose target has been transferred later on, pose a problem as
			the DE line of the flat file is generated by default using the information
			in the HISTORY_EVENTS table, that is only one target, and only the next (not
			the final one).
			Other EC numbers are deleted by NC-IUBMB, but SIB prefers to consider them
			as transferred to existing EC numbers. Their DE line should read
			"Transferred to..." instead of "Deleted entry".
			<br/>
			So we need to translate these DE lines. To that end, we use the file
			<code>resources/DE_line_modifications.properties</code>, which lists
			the EC numbers whose DE line should be changed because of the above reasons,
			mapped to the new (modified) DE line.

        <subsection name="Other formatting exceptions">
        Other exceptions must be done to get the right format. For example,
        the characters 'sp.' don't mean the end of a sentence. This concrete
        case is defined in CC_LineFormatter.jara.
