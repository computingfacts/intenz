    <b><i>Abstract:</i></b><br/>
<p>
Carbonate dehydratase, better known as carbonic anhydrase (CA), was first identified in 1932 by 
Meldrum and Roughton in red blood cells, but it has since been found in organisms from all 
kingdoms of life. <i>In vivo</i>, CA catalyses the hydration of

(CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and the dehydration of

The inhibition of human CA is important in the treatment of glaucoma, 
altitude sickness, and obesity, while its overexpression has recently been implicated in tumour
growth [1]. In phytoplankton, CA plays an essential part in the acquisition of inorganic carbon 
for photosynthesis. CA is categorised into three main classes: &alpha;-CA (found in mammals, 
plants, 
eubacteria, and viruses), &beta;-CA (plants, bacteria, and some animals) and &gamma;-CA
(bacteria and plants), which 
share no significant sequence similarity or overall structure, but which all contain a catalytic 
zinc atom. Whereas &alpha;- and &gamma;-CA use three histidine residues to coordinate zinc,
&beta;-CA uses two cysteine residues and one histidine residue.
&alpha;-CA was one of the first proteins for which a crystal structure was obtained.
This is an enzyme that is particularly well suited to serve as a model in many types of 
biophysical studies of protein&ndash;ligand binding [1]. 

Two new classes of CA have been discovered in marine diatoms: &delta;-CA, with an active site
similar to that of &alpha;-CA, and &zeta;-CA, which naturally uses cadmium as its catalytic 
metal. The high-resolution crystal structures of cadmium carbonic anhydrase 1 (CDCA1) from the 
model diatom species <i>Thalassiosira weissflogii</i> has been recently reported [2]. Although 
CDCA1 is isolated as a native Cd enzyme, it can use either Zn or Cd for catalysis and 
spontaneously exchanges the two metals.
