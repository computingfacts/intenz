This package contains classes for writing the <code>enzyme.dat</code> flat file.
<p>
The flat file writer is comprised of classes responsible for proper formatting of the individual line types and
classes defining rules for line wrapping. Two interfaces are provided which can be implemented to provide
additional classes for formatting or wrapping.
<p>
The formatting classes take care that the lines will get the expected format in the end. At the moment two classes
exist whereas the <code>DefaultLineFormatter</code> defines the format of all line types.
The CC line is a special case and handled by the <code>CC_LineFormatter</code>.
<p>
Finally the line wrapping classes can be retrieved using the <code>LineWrapperFactory</code>. This factory contains
some nested classes which cover different line wrapping scenarios which are usually not connected to any specific
line type, hence the distinction of these two components.
